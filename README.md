This is our PDF Reader

It can extract text, add watermarks, split PDF's into differnt files, combine two pdfs into one, and rotate PDF's 

To test the watermark use the watermark.PDF.

The test, test2 and sample are all test files, with the sample is for the text reader.  The rest of the files are what we used to test and their outputs.
